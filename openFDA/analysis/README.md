# analysis

This folder contains the ML analysis of this project. The main structure I used was logistic regression over the summer, and some results can be seen in the dimensionMatrix.xlsx file.

### Files

__logisticR.py__ - bulk of analysis, contains all of the setup needed to run the logistic regression

__optimize.py__ - small GA to optimize K_best feature selection

__test.py__ - an attempt to see how well the models could do with new test data
