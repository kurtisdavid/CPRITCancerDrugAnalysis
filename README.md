# CPRITCancerDrugAnalysis
Contains the scripts I wrote for my summer experience in the School of Biomedical Informatics, which includes the analysis I did through ML.


Contains Two Folders:

MedDRA: Contains the methods I used to extract a local database of Adverse Drug Events from MedDRA to be used in the analysis.

openFDA: Inspired by the openFDA API, contains the files I used to mine data from the FAERS database. Unfortunately could not make use of openFDA due to their limitations, but many thanks to them for providing all of their JSON files for the reports.
